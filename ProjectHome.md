Pyoptic is an optics and physics simulation based on python and uses scipy as a calculation engine, matplotlib and tvtk for visualisation.
It is mainly intended for simple simulations of optical engineering, imaging systems, laser systems, laser transportation and applications, lens design etc.

Currently there is only one developer (myself) and it would be great if people who have an interest joined. I am currently working on the diffraction calculations, something I need for my research. If there are any physics students (undergraduate, post-graduate), postdoctoral researchers and just generally interested people, please contact me and maybe start contributing some code. I am a average python programmer and am using this project to improve my skills so you don't have to be very professional. Also if you are a teacher/educator the code can be modified for teaching examples and classes, again get in touch.
